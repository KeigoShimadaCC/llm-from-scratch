## Known TODOs

- Restricted-agent delegate internals are excluded from the packaged export. The stage writes evidence and blocks clearly if enabled.
- Real end-to-end agent, PR, merge, and cleanup flows must be validated in each target repository before granting authority flags.
- YAML config support is intentionally minimal.
- `plan --idea` is deterministic starter planning only; full autonomous LLM planning is not implemented.
- `boom` is an orchestration macro only; it does not execute agents, create PRs, or merge.
- `inspect` and `why-blocked` summarize known package evidence shapes; custom target-repo evidence may need adapters later.
- `create-agentic-runner` is a local folder copier, not a package manager installer.
- Provider presets are command-template starters only; target repos still need local review before supervised shell execution.
- Command-safety checks are deterministic pattern matching, not a full shell parser or sandbox.

## Excluded

- `runs/**` — generated evidence
- `.env*` — secrets
- repo-specific phase evidence
- local worktree paths
- existing lockfiles outside the package
- current PR numbers, commit hashes, run IDs, and private local paths
- source-repo-specific application code, content, and tests
